To fix that no money ends up in CashRegister, we added code to Cashier.java.  

After the cashier informs the customer how much money they owe at line 64 in the provideService method,

we added code to check if the customer has enough money to finialize the purchase at like 66.

If the customer has enough money in their wallet, then at line 71 we call the payCashier method of the customer class.

We subsequently call the recievePayment method of the cashier class at line 73.
