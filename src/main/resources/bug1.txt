To make the Bakery more flexible and able to sell more than cakes ad muffins,

we first removed the cakePrice and muffinePrice fields from the StoreOwner class and the cakeCount and muffinCount fields from the Inventory class.

They are replaced with two HashMaps in the Invemtory class. inventoryMap and priceMap have a String as the key, the food item, 

and as values they have the number of that particular food item in stock and the price of that food item, respectively.

From here, we had to add new methods and change many of the existing ones of the StoreOwner class.

Since the HashMaps are private fields of the Inventory class, the implementation of many of the methods are collaborations with the Inventory class.

addToMenu is a new method that takes a String parameter and adds the new menu item to both HashMaps.

getCakePrice and getMuffinPrice have been consolidated into getPrice.

setCakePrice and setMuffinPrice have been consolidated into setPrice.

getCakeCount and getMuffinCount have been consolidated into getCount.

addCakesToInventory and addMuffinsToInventory have been consolidated into addToInventory.

removeCakesFromInventory and removeMuffinsFromInventory have been consolidated into subtractFromInventory.

With these changes the Bakery better adheres to the Open-Closed Principle by enabling the Bakery to sell a wider variety of items in the future.
