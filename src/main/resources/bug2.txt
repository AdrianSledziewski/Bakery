To fix that no money ends up in CashRegister, we added code to Cashier.java.  

In the provideService method, after it is determined that the customer has enough money in their wallet and that there is enough inventory to fulfill the order,

at like 69 we call the payCashier method of the customer class. 

We subsequently call the recievePayment method of the cashier class at line 71.
