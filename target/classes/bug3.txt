To enable the cashier to collaborate with the baker directly 

we added a private Baker field to the Cashier class at line 17 as well as altered the constructor

for the Cashier class at line 23 to take a second parameter: a Baker object.

At line 59 we changed what happens if the inventory is too low to fulfill an order.

Instead of printing out an error, Cashier is now directly able to collaborate with Baker and call

the bake method of the Baker class.
